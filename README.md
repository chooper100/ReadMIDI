# ReadMIDI
C#.Net library for reading *.mid files

## Usage
A demo project using the ReadMIDI library can be found in the **/Demo** directory.

## Credits
Although no external libraries were used in this project, I'd just like to list some of the
websites I used that really helped me whilst working on the project:
